# NeuroCausal

The base code of NeuroCausal, a platform for meta-analysis of the neuropsychological data inspired by [NeuroQuery](https://github.com/neuroquery/neuroquery).

Given a cognitive/psychological term (e.g. face processing), it produces a brain map of the brain area whose integrity is necessary to enable such processe/representation (e.g. a lesion in that area would lead to prosopagnosia).
